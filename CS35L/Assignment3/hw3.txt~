Question 1

The line "case_long_iso_time_style:" is a label for the

Since 'case_long_iso_time_style:' is a label for the goto command,
only one of which to this label is in 'ls.c', and that line is deleted
in the patch, we can safely remove it.

It was not necessary to remove that line since it affects nothing.
The compiler will ignore it since nothing uses this label.


Question 2

If no translation was found by the function 'dcgettext',
it will return the same value as long_time_format[i].

So for locales that do not have a translation, 
it will display something that the particular language speaker
cannot understand.

The --time-style=long-iso option still works, 
but not everyone knows this command. 
So it is not a good idea generally to patch it the way Brady did.


Question 3

When trying to run randline script on /dev/null, output is:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
  IndexError: list index out of range

This is because the function is trying to choose a line from an empty file without any lines, which will result in undefined behavior.


Question 4

Running randline.py with python2 outputs the correct thing i.e. random lines.

Running randline.py with python3 outputs:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Syntax in python 3 is changed so running the script in python 3 will result in an error.

By python 3 documentation, in python3 IOError is merged into OSError,
and the corresponding argument changed.

The correct way should be:

except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
