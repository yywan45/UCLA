Compare using the patched diff

Command: diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
Compare the two patches
Many differences in the output



There seem to be a lot of differences, but the don't differ in actual contents.
The differences are mainly from paths for files and hashes.

In quote-3.0-test.txt, the diff part for diff3.c is ahead of diff.c,
while in quote-3.0-patch.txt, it comes after diff.c.

When I clip them to be in the same position (I created a new file for this)
Every difference is innocuous.
