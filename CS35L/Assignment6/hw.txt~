The gpg --verify command doesn't help since it only verifies if the signatures match and are good.

I could post my public key or detached signature file online.
Anyone who downloads my tar file can verify whether the file is created by me and whether it is modified.
Certificate authorities can verify to the receiver that they have the right key from the correct owner.
